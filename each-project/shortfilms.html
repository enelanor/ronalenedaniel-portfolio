                                <p>The concept for these videos was to create short cinematography pieces that tell a meaningful story, each ending with a lesson or takeaway. During the brainstorming phase, ideas were explored, focusing on relatable moments from everyday life and how they could be visually represented. The goal was to make stories that felt impactful. The challenge was to find ways to convey these messages visually, using minimal dialogue and relying more on cinematography and editing to communicate the story.

                                <p>The concept behind the videos was to create short, visually stories that would offer a lesson at the end. Each video focused on simple yet impactful moments that could connect with the viewer on a personal level. The idea was to use minimal dialogue and rely heavily on cinematography and editing to tell the story.
                                </p>
                                <p>During the rough draft phase, several ideas were sketched out, experimenting with different narratives and ways to visually present the lesson. Early drafts included exploring a variety of settings and characters, with multiple approaches to framing and pacing.</p>

                                <p>For this project, all images and sounds were sourced from non-copyrighted resources. It was important to find images that would seamlessly integrate into the overall cinematography, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. Similarly, the soundtracks were chosen to enhance the emotional tone of the story, using royalty-free music and sound effects that complemented the visuals without distracting from the narrative. 
                                <p>
                                One of the videos, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ZBw7HMhFaXk?si=ahzuVxmUfvOTAz-q" target="_blank">"this video is a sign to not give up"</a></strong>, the student created their own soundtrack in GarageBand. This approach allowed for high-quality production while respecting copyright laws.

                                <p>The process began with writing the story down then planning each frame and scene in note form using Google Docs. This helped map out the visual flow of the videos, making it easier to organize the sequence of events. After that, the lighting, camera angles, and shot composition were planned out to ensure each scene looked exactly how it was envisioned.
                                </p>
                                <p>Once everything was set, the filming began. Each shot was carefully executed based on the initial planning. After filming, the editing process started using CapCut. This stage focused on putting the footage together, adjusting the pacing, and refining the overall flow, while layering in sound and visual effects to make the final product as clean as possible.
                                </p>
