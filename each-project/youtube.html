                        <p>The goal was to grow the student’s personal YouTube channel by doing a talk show series called May’s Munchtime, while continuously evaluating and observing each video made every week to improve the next one. The main purpose of this project was to gain experience and learn more about social media marketing and content creation through YouTube.

                            <p>Graphic design skills played a huge part when creating the thumbnails for YouTube or promotional templates for Instagram's story feature. Softwares such as Canva, and Adobe Photoshop were mostly used.</p>
                            <p> <strong>Strategies that were thought of when creating the YouTube Thumbnails:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Added large, easy-to-read text to highlight the key message.</li>
                                <li>Clear, high-resolution images to give a professional look.</li>
                                <li>Focused on Faces & Emotions with an expressive emotion often draw more attention.</li>
                                <li>Used colors that pop to grab attention</li>
                                <li> Used a consistent style across thumbnails so viewers can quickly identify videos.</li>

                                <p>May’s Munchtime is a talk show series where the host, May, talks and eats with guests about being Filipino in Canada. The demographics showed that most viewers were Filipino immigrants, which influenced the choice of video topics. Rough drafts included a script made in Google Docs, prepared before filming, which outlined all the questions to be sent to the guests a day in advance so they could have time to think about their responses.</p>
                                <p>Down below is one of the scripts prepared in Google Docs. </p>

                                <p>Information discussed in the video was based on the host’s and guest’s personal experiences when answering questions. If a fact or statement was quoted, it was checked and researched during the editing process to ensure accuracy. Images, audio, and video clips were sourced from non-copyrighted resources.</p>

                                <p>First, a script was created that detailed the time, food, and questions to be included in the video. The title of the video was determined early on to set a clear idea of its focus. The set was designed with three cameras to capture different angles, and lighting played a significant role in creating the mood. Since this was a talk show, the microphone was crucial and had to be carefully placed to capture audio properly. Everything was double-checked before filming began to avoid mistakes.</p>
                                <p>Once the guest arrived, filming started. Afterward, the footage was transferred to a computer, and the editing process began using the video editing software CapCut. The thumbnail was created using Adobe Photoshop and Canva. Additional research was conducted to ensure the video ranked high for SEO. Keywords for the description box, titles, and tags were carefully chosen to help the video compete effectively. Finally, after uploading, the video was promoted through other social media platforms. A YouTube Shorts version was also created in CapCut and posted daily throughout the week.
